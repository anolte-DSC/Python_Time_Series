## Material for the workshop "Time Series Analysis and Prediction" with focus on Earth Sciences at the Data Science Center (DSC), University of Bremen.

The repository consists of:
- Notebooks (Python notebooks with code for time series analysis and prediction)
  - A) Quickstart into Python
  - B) Time series basics in Python
  - C) Time series statistics 
  - D) Earth Sciences examples
- Images (images loaded in the code)
- Datasets (datasets loaded in the code)
- Slides (presented during the workshop)

The material was developed by Annika Nolte and Maryam Movahedifar. The sources and references for images and datasets are given in the notebooks. The "C) Time series statistics" notebooks contain code from the following workbook: Huang, C. and Petukhina, A.: Applied time series analysis and forecasting with Python, Springer, 2022.
