## Material for the workshop "Time Series Analysis and Prediction" with focus on Earth Sciences at the Data Science Center (DSC), University of Bremen.

The repository consists of:
- Notebooks_Exercises (Python notebooks with code for time series analysis and prediction including unsolved exercises)
- Notebooks_Solutions (Python notebooks with code for time series analysis and prediction including exercises with solutions) 
- Images (images loaded in the code)
- Datasets (datasets loaded in the code)
- Slides (presented during the workshop)
- requirements.txt (List of libraries required to run the notebooks)

The notebooks contain:
- A) Quickstart into Python
- B) Time series basics in Python
- C) Time series statistics 
- D) Earth Sciences examples

To install the libraries open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
In Jupyter Notebook, you can also run shell commands like `pip install -r requirements.txt` directly from a code cell by prefixing the command with an exclamation mark (`!`): !pip install -r requirements.txt

The material was developed by Annika Nolte and Maryam Movahedifar. The sources and references for images and datasets are given in the notebooks. The "C) Time series statistics" notebooks contain code from the following workbook: Huang, C. and Petukhina, A.: Applied time series analysis and forecasting with Python, Springer, 2022.
